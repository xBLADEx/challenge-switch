## Notes

### Data

> - Data Source: Use the sample JSON in this repo or your own small dataset.
> - No backend required. You may simulate network latency/errors with a small helper.

For this project I decided to directly import the JSON data, no need for fetch calls.
Ideally I would use react-query but based on the instructions I didn't think it was needed.

The trade-off here is now the data is part of my final bundle size. I wanted to note this.
