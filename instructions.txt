Switch Frontend Take-Home Challenge
============================

Build a small “Mini Catalog” web app where users can browse items, search/filter/sort them, view details, and mark favorites. 


1) Goals
--------
We’re assessing:
- TypeScript fundamentals and practical frontend skills
- Clean, maintainable code and project structure
- Data handling (search/filter/sort), basic async flows, and state
- Responsive layout and accessibility basics
- Small but meaningful tests
- Thoughtful trade-offs and documentation


2) Requirements
---------------
Language:
- TypeScript (required)

Framework/Tooling:
- Your choice. React and/or Next.js are encouraged but not required.
- Styling is up to you. We use Tailwind, but use whatever you are compfortable with. (Vanilla CSS, CSS Modules, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, etc.)
- Feel free to use any additional libraries of your choice, but keep bundle size in mind.

Core Features:
- Catalog List:
  - Display a list or grid of items (ex. title/name, category, short description).
  - Search by name/description.
  - Filter by category.
  - Sort by one or more of: name, price, rating, category.
  - Show loading/empty/error states if you simulate fetching.
- Item Detail:
  - Dedicated page/route OR a modal with more info (e.g., full description, price/rating).
  - Include a Favorite toggle.
- Favorites:
  - Favorite/unfavorite items from list and detail.
  - Persist favorites using localStorage.
- Responsive & Accessible:
  - Usable on mobile through desktop (≈ 320px to 1440px+).
  - Semantic HTML, labeled inputs, visible focus, reasonable color contrast.
  - Keyboard navigable (tab, enter/space on buttons/controls).

Nice-to-Have (Optional, do only if time permits):
- Dark mode toggle (persisted; respects prefers-color-scheme if you like).
- Debounced search and URL-synced state (e.g., ?q=&category=&sort=).
- Skeleton loaders for initial load.
- Any other features you want to add. Feel free to get creative!


3) Scope Guardrails
-------------------
- Data Source: Use the sample JSON in this repo or your own small dataset.
- No backend required. You may simulate network latency/errors with a small helper.
- If AI assistance is used, please explain for which tasks and how.
- Please return within 1 week. If time runs short, complete the core flows and note trade-offs.


4) Deliverables
---------------
Please provide:
- A repository link (GitHub/GitLab/etc.) or a ZIP of the project.
- A README including:
  - How to run and build the project
  - Tech choices and trade-offs
  - What you’d improve with more time
  - Any deviations from the spec
- (Optional) A live deployment link (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)
